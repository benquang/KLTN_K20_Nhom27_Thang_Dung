    "**Explain the ELO expression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression 1 / (1 + 10 ** ((rating2 - rating1) / 400)) is often used in the Elo rating system to calculate the expected outcome or probability of winning for a player in a two-player game or competition. Here's a breakdown of how this expression works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (rating2 - rating1) / 400: This part calculates the difference between the ratings of two players, rating2 and rating1. It divides the difference by 400. The division by 400 is a scaling factor used in the Elo rating system to adjust the impact of rating differences on the expected outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10 ** ((rating2 - rating1) / 400): The result of step 1 is raised to the power of 10. This exponential calculation increases the impact of rating differences, as the larger the difference, the more the probability of winning or losing is affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 + 10 ** ((rating2 - rating1) / 400): In this step, 1 is added to the result of step 2. This adjustment ensures that the denominator is always greater than 1, resulting in a value between 0 and 1 for the entire expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 / (1 + 10 ** ((rating2 - rating1) / 400)): Finally, the expression is inverted by dividing 1 by the value obtained in step 3. The purpose of this inversion is to convert the value into a probability or expected outcome. The result will be a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the player with rating1 winning against the player with rating2 in the Elo rating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the expression 1 / (1 + 10 ** ((rating2 - rating1) / 400)) calculates the expected outcome or probability of winning for a player with rating1 against a player with rating2 in the Elo rating system, based on the difference between their ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is K and 400:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- K: The K constant represents the weight or magnitude of the rating update. It determines how much a player's rating will change based on the outcome of a match. A higher value of K will result in larger rating adjustments, while a lower value will lead to smaller adjustments. The value of 30 used in the code snippet is a common choice for K, but it can be adjusted according to the specific requirements of your Elo rating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 400: The 400 constant is the standard scaling factor used in the Elo rating formula. It determines the sensitivity of the rating changes based on the difference in ratings between two players or teams. A larger value of 400 will result in smaller changes to ratings, while a smaller value will lead to more significant adjustments. The choice of 400 is a convention in the Elo rating system, but you can adjust it if desired."
